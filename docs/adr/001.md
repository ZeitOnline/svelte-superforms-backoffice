# ADR 001 / Rebrush of Backoffices

Datum: 02.09.2024

## Context

When the team Engagement & Games was created, we received the task of creating new backoffices for three games: Eckchen, Wortiger and Buchstabiene. The company who created these games, Folge3, had done already some backoffices and we could have taken this as an example and just replicate, but we decided to create the new backoffices from scratch by using Sveltekit instead of the technologies used by Folge3 (Angular for frontend and Nestjs for backend) 

## Old structure (Angular + Nestjs)

As mentioned, the old structure would be the one of the backoffices created by Folge3 before the creation of the team Engagement & Games. 

### Pros

- The robust compact skeleton is there
- Authentication with Microsoft Azure is already there
- It works, people working with it are happy


### Cons

- We agreed on using Svelte whenever is possible. We need a lot of time to dive into the code (learn Angular and Nestjs) 
- We need to spot what needs to be changed to adapt to the new game structures
- Not modern UI 

## New structure (Sveltekit)

As mentioned, the old structure would be the one of the backoffices created by Folge3 before the creation of the team Engagement & Games. 

### Pros

- We can style faster the UI with our Design System thanks to TailwindCSS 
- We are using Svelte, which is the technology we agreed on using
- It will be easier to add new features since we know how to use the framework

### Cons

- Everything needs to be done from scratch (design, frontend and backend, validation)
- We will need to implement the authentication of Microsoft Azure

## Decision

The new structure.

## Status

Proposal.

## Consequences
